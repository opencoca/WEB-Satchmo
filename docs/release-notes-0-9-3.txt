Migration Notes

PDF generation
++++++++++++++

If you wish to maintain the ``trml2pdf`` PDF generation (recommended if you
have customized templates) for invoices, packing slips and shipping labels,
you must set the ``'DOCUMENT_CONVERTER'`` key
within ``SATCHMO_SETTINGS`` to ``'shipping.views.TRMLDocument'``::

    SATCHMO_SETTINGS = {
        ...
        'DOCUMENT_CONVERTER': 'shipping.views.TRMLDocument',
        ...
    }

You should also move your templates, as the following template renames happened
(here is indicated only the *template path*, from ``templates/`` onward):

    * ``shop/pdf/invoice.rml`` → ``shop/docs/rml/invoice.rml``
    * ``shop/pdf/packing-slip.rml`` → ``shop/docs/rml/packingslip.rml``
    * ``shop/pdf/shipping-label.rml`` → ``shop/docs/rml/shippinglabel.rml``

See :ref:`document_settings_trml2pdf` for more details.

Sorl Thumbnail
++++++++++++++
In `rev 2449 <http://bitbucket.org/chris1610/satchmo/changeset/9fb522d26404>`_ Satchmo is updated to use the latest Sorl Thumbnail code.

The primary change is that all custom templates that reference images, will need to be changed to support Sorl's updated syntax. 
A typical example of an old template tag looks like this::

    {% thumbnail pic.picture 280x280 as image %}
    <img src="{{ image }}" width="{{ image.width }}" height="{{ image.height }}" />
    
Templates need to be updated to support the endthumbnail tag::

    {% thumbnail pic.picture "280x280" as image %}
    <img src="{{ image.url }}" width="{{ image.width }}" height="{{ image.height }}" />
    {% endthumbnail %}

Also, after upgrading to the latest Sorl Thumbnail code, you must remember to do a syncdb to create Sorl's cache table.

This upgrade allows Satchmo to utilize all the latest features in Sorl. You are encouraged to read `Sorl's docs <http://thumbnail.sorl.net/index.html>`_ in order to determine 
which ones you'd like to include in your store.

Django Static Files
+++++++++++++++++++
In `rev 2476 <https://bitbucket.org/chris1610/satchmo/changeset/3848d39b63c0>`_ Satchmo is updated to use Django's static files. If you have made any changes to templates, you'll need to make sure
to replace references top media_url with STATIC_URL. Here is an example of the original template::

    <script src="{{media_url}}js/jquery.cookie.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    
Here is the new template::
    
    <script src="{{ STATIC_URL }}js/jquery.cookie.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
